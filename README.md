# Machine Learning Specialization Notes

This repository is dedicated for tracking my daily notes for the [Machine Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction) on Coursera.

## About the Course
This specialization provides an introduction to the key concepts of machine learning, data mining, and statistical pattern recognition. It covers both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques, model evaluation, and optimization techniques.

The course is divided into three main parts:
1. **Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification**
2. **Advanced Learning Algorithms**
3. **Unsupervised Learning, Recommenders, Reinforcement Learning**

## Repository Structure
This repository will contain the HTML files of regular notes and summaries from the course lectures and readings. Each note will be organized by course section/module for easy reference.
